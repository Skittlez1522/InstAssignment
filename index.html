        <h2>Essays</h2>
        <p>Writing essays is difficult and takes up a lot of time. Not only that, but for most people, its not very enjoyable. Because of that, people usually don't proof read their essays after they finish it. If that is you, allow us to proof read, note, and give you suggestions on how to make your essay better. We will do this for you through any form of communication you see fit, whether it be talking through Snapchat, Facetiming, or joining a Zoom call. We will work around your schedule too, so you don't have to work around ours.</p>
        <p>Another service we offer for essay writing to help you as you write it. This means we will join a call or view your essay as you are writing it, helping fix any punctuation or grammatical errors and offering suggestions on how to better write a sentence or how you should organize your essay.</p>
